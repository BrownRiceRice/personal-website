<h2>LOGO: Turtle Graphics</h2>

I'm currently taking COMP 360 at Rice, and the first part of the
class is focused on Turtle Graphics, a way of generating 2D shapes
and fractals. <!-- Add link here! -->

I always liked fractals in middle and high school, I'd doodle Seprenski
Gaskets and my papers and always try to draw super comple dragon curves.
I also really like the simplicity of the turtel, so I decided to make
a demo using StageXl and Dart! Try out the demo below.
