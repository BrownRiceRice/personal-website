        For HackRice 6, a <a href="https://githubcom/pjh5">friend</a> and I made a procedurally created Oculus Rift
        game. It was a blast to actually get working, but it's a little disappointing now that I can't play and keep
        improving it. I'm teaching myself OpenGL/WebGL so I can port the game to general PC, and maybe this website!

        Until then, here are some screenshots from the game in action.
