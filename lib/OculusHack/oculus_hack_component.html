    <p>
        For HackRice 6, a <a href="https://github.com/pjh5">friend</a> and I made a procedurally-generated Oculus Rift
        game. It was a blast to actually get working, so much so that I decided to 
        <a href="https://github.com/BryceStevenWilley/forest_game">port it to Mac</a>! The installation isn't general
        yet (some of the library locations are hardcoded to my machine), but feel free to open a Github issue or pull
        request about that. I'm teaching myself WebGL so I can port to this website too!

        Here are some screenshots from the game in action (Oculus version).
