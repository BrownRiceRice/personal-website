<h2>Hack Rice 2016: No Man's Forest</h2>

<section>
    For HackRice 6, I and a <a href="https://githubcom/pjh5">friend</a> made a procedurally created Oculus Rift game.
    It was a blast to actually get working, and a little disappointing, now that I can play it and keep improving it.
    But here are some snapshots of the game in action. I'm trying to actually teach myself OpenGL so I can port the game
    to general PC (probably Mac or Linux first), so keep on the watch for that.
