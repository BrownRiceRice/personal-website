# Old website

Once upon a time I interned at Google and learned Angular2-dart. From that I decided to actually make a website with it, and this was that website. 
However, dart keeps changing, and I keep not ever working on web-dev, so I made a simpler to maintain website at https://brycewilley.xyz (https://github.com/BryceStevenWilley/BryceStevenWilley.github.io), and just left the dart-specific interactive bits here. They're still linked to and live on the original website (https://brycewilley.xyz/dart-projects).
